<p>This project actually started a long time ago before writing this post. However, I paused it for a while due to several reasons and challenges.</p>

<p>Some of these struggles were related to the project itself, while others were personal. In this post, I want to focus on the project-related challenges and clarify a few things about the journey so far.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>I created this blog to document my journey in building this operating system from scratch.</p>

<p>The main goal is to keep track of every step I take — from early experiments and learning phases to major updates and design changes. Whenever I modify something, improve a component, or face a challenge, I try to write about it here.</p>

<p>This blog is not only a personal log but also a way to share knowledge with anyone who is interested in operating systems development and low-level programming.</p>

<h2 id="references">References</h2>

<p>This journey began with a strong passion to learn about operating systems and eventually build one for myself.</p>

<p>I started searching for the required knowledge and found many useful resources. Based on several Reddit posts and technical blogs, I decided to begin with the <strong>x86 architecture</strong> and follow a structured learning path by
watching this YouTube playlist to better understand <strong>x86 architecture</strong>:
<a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfzBO7vcQZ1Kyq7RNPJM5NUP-PWwRVZOX&amp;si=6pvl1IRRNkLQYKDx">8086 - Bharat Acharya</a></p>

<p>In addition, I followed the main reference for operating system development:
<a href="https://osdev.org/">osdev.org</a></p>

<p>And i also was reading these books :</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/saeeedhany/references/blob/main/OS/Operating%20Systems%20-%20Three%20Easy%20Pieces.pdf">Operating Systems: From 0 to 1</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/saeeedhany/references/blob/main/OS/Operating_Systems_From_0_to_1.pdf">Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/saeeedhany/references/blob/main/OS/book.pdf">The Little Book About OS Development</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-thoughts">Some Thoughts</h2>

<p>This project represents my true passion and the field I want to pursue as a career.</p>

<p>Even though the learning process includes many frustrating moments, I genuinely enjoy every step of it. One thing I would really love is to have people who share the same passion — whether by adopting the idea, giving feedback, or contributing in any possible way.</p>

<p>So if you’re reading this right now and feel that you can offer something, I would truly appreciate it.</p>
